The paper simulation.slx is the experimental simulation for the paper "Low-Complexity Prescribed Performance Control for Unknown Eulerâ€“Lagrange Systems Under Actuator Faults". The experiment consists of two cases: one where the initial conditions are within the range of the performance function, and the other where the initial conditions are outside the range of the performance function. The zip folder contains the images of the experimental simulation.
