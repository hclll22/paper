This repository provides the simulation code and model for the paper "Low-Complexity Prescribed Performance Control Of Unknown Euler–Lagrange Systems Under Actuator Faults" published in IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems Part II: Express Briefs. The model is used to verify the effectiveness of the proposed control strategy for a two-link manipulator system with actuator faults.
In Case 1, the joint angles (q) and angular velocities (\(\dot{q}\)) of the manipulator rapidly track the target trajectory, with errors converging to the preset asymmetric intervals. In Case 2, even when initial conditions violate the constraints, the controller can still confine the errors within the adjusted intervals, demonstrating its robustness.
